for the main logic of the game

here are the main components

1- Time (unit)
2- Down
3- To Go
4- Ball on (number of total score remaining out of 50)

when we select an option, its either correct or incorrect, here is the scenario:

1- if CORRECT, then get random number of yards (1-15) 
show it to the user, subtract
these from the 'Ball on' if 
these randomNumberOfYards >= 10 then your 'Down' is 
still the same, otherwise your 'Down' 
is increased by 1 (e.g it becomes 2 in this case).
Also keep subtracting your randomNumberOfYards 
from 'Ball on'.
Also if randomNumberOfYards is < 10 then subtract them 
from 'To Go' as well.

2- if INCORRECT, then everything remains the same, 
we start again from the same place, but the 
'Down' is increased by 1 as well.




TOUCHDOWN

happens when the 'Ball on' are <= 0

we need to show a touch down screen and then after 
a certain while the football shot scene across the wind-
direction


A new requirement from the client for touchdown effect

since we have time units from 15 to 1,
split this into 50%
 if we're in first 50% then the away score will always be 0 or 7
 and vice versa for the remaining 50%
